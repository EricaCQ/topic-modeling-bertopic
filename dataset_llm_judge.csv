positive,66,the food was average to above - average 
positive,67,"however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !"
negative,68,the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n ' t even fully melted !

positive,196,try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .
positive,197,"service was very good - prompt , attentive and non - intrusive ."
positive,198,"food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt - in - your - mouth experience ) ."
positive,199,wine list selection is good and wine - by - the - glass was generously filled to the top .
Neutral,200,traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .

positive,262,the yellowtail was particularly good as well .
Negative,263,"i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however - - the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu ."
Positive,264,"in any event , this is a place i ' ll be sure to stop by again when i ' m in this part of town ."
positive,265,big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment .

positive,318,check this place out !
positive,319,highly recommended ! ! ! ! !
negative,320,"first of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch ' s editorial review ."
negative,321,"either that , or the editor ' s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th ."
negative,322,"the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced ."
Neutral,323,slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
negative,324,service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
Negative,325,"for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc . . . ."
negative,326,somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .
Negative,327,"to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n ' t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora ."
Negative,328,not one of our meals was edible - bland and / or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .
negative,329,fish was overdone .
negative,330,"cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again ."
negative,331,someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .

positive,340,you will find yourself returning quite often .
positive,341,a restaurant that does n ' t try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .
positive,342,no gimmicks here - - the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .
positive,343,the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over - - how refreshing !
positive,344,"the service was impeccable and unobtrusive - - the staff knows what they are there to do - - to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs ."
positive,345,"looking around , i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen ."
positive,346,the view is breathtaking the service is top notch . . . the ambiance is wonderful .

negative,641,so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !
negative,642,"for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !"
